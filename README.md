My name in real life is _LiangXiang Shen_ or **Áî≥ËâØÊπò** in Chinese.

## What do you do except playing games? üìù

I have a toy-level project [kjBot](https://github.com/kjBot-Dev) written in php.

Beyond that it's translating, especially for indie free softwares (or games). There's no much money for me to sponsor the developers, but helping them bring these to more users/players is the best I can do. It also improve my skills so I'm enjoying this very much.

Here's a list of softwares/games that I joined translation team: (Don't mind me advertising them üòâ)
