# Greeting 👋

You must be interested in me, that's why you opened my profile, don't you? So let me introduce myself.

## Who am I? 🤷‍♂️

I'd prefer you to call me _kj415j45_ or _kj_ for shorter.  
My name in real life is _LiangXiang Shen_ or **申良湘** in Chinese.  
I don't actually have an English name. But if you want, you can use _Bruce_. My English teacher gave me this name, but I haven't used it for a long time.

Leader of [@osu-translate-zh](https://github.com/osu-translate-zh). Currently working at [@guiyunbao](https://github.com/guiyunbao) as Tech Lead.

**You can also use [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/kj415j45/kj415j45/issues/new?template=conversation.yaml) to have a public talk with me if you like. :)**
