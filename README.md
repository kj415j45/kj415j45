# Greeting 👋

You must be interested in me, that's why you open my profile, don't you? So let me introduce myself.

## Who am I? 🤷‍♂️

I'd prefer to call me _kj415j45_ or _kj_ for shorter.  
My name in real life is _LiangXiang Shen_ or **申良湘** in Chinese.  
I don't actually have a English name. But if you want, you can use _Bruce_. My English teacher give me this name, but I haven't used it for a long time.

Currently working at [@guiyunbao](https://github.com/guiyunbao) as Tech Lead.

**Follow my telegram channel [@kjMerge](https://t.me/kjMerge) and join the discussion group to communicate with me directly.**

## What have I done yet? 📝

I have a toy-level project [kjBot](https://github.com/kjBot-Dev) written in php and [maid](https://pub.dev/packages/maid) library written in dart.

Set up full DevOps env (CI/CD) for my company.

Beyond that it's translating, especially for indie free softwares (or games).
Here's a list of softwares/games that I joined the translation team:
